A Sudoku solver is created to solve any Sudoku puzzles.

The Sudoku puzzle should be written as a string with 81 lenghts. For the cells that are already populated, enter the integer. For the empty cells to be solved, use '.'.

A python package called python-constraint is used in this solver. For more information, please visit https://pypi.org/project/python-constraint/
